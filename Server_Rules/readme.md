## 👋 Welcome

Welcome to Koalaty Roleplay! Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our rules to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for all players.

## 🔔 Important Information

- 🚫 Refrain from sending any Admin or Owner a Direct Message on Discord unless asked to. They will not respond. If you need to get in contact with one of them, create a support ticket.
- 🎮 You are NOT allowed to approach or call any Owner, Admin, or Developer in the city to ask about any ticket progress, development queries, or general out-of-city information. When any Owner, Admin, or Developer is in the city, they are there to roleplay (RP) and should not be treated differently.
- ⚠️ Failure to comply will result in a Tier Warning.

## 🔐 Your Account

- 🔒 It is your sole responsibility to keep your account details secure and confidential. Koalaty Roleplay will not take any responsibility for hacked accounts.

## 👶 IRL Player Age

- 🎂 Our Roleplay community is intended for players aged 18 and above to ensure a mature and responsible environment for storytelling and character interactions.

## 🎙 Microphone/Audio

- 🎧 Microphone and Audio functionality must always be operational for seamless communication with other citizens.
- 🎤 To maintain a respectful atmosphere, please ensure to use the “Push-To-Talk” feature as the default setting.

## 🚸 Behavior

- ❌ Any form of harassment or attack towards another Roleplay player will result in a ban from the server.
- 💢 We do NOT condone any form of toxicity towards any player. This includes excessive use of foul language, racist remarks, sexism, and roleplay using bodily fluids inappropriately (e.g., pee, spitting, and pooping on someone). This includes the use of emotes and /me in scenes.

## 🚷 Poaching

- 👥 Poaching is strictly prohibited. If you are not actively participating in our city’s RP and are solely here to recruit players for another server, you will face a ban.

## 🚫 Prohibited Roleplay

- We do not condone any of the following roleplay scenes:
  - 🚨 Suicidal Roleplay
  - 🚔 Sexual Assault
  - 🚓 Corrupt Law Enforcement Officials
  - 🔞 Erotic Roleplay (Sexual RP)
  - ⚖️ All legal matters, disputes, and infractions within the server must go through the court system at City Hall. This ensures that justice is served through proper roleplay procedures.

## 🗣 In-City Words

The following words are used in the city for out-of-city reference:

- **🧠 In head** - Not by PC
- **🧠 Brain** - Your PC
- **👀 Eyes** - Your Screen
- **🎙 Voicebox** - Your Microphone
- **🎧 Ears** - Your Headset
- **👽 Alien** - Real Life
- **👤 Person In Alien** - In Real Life
- **🏛 Government** - Admin Team
- **👑 President** - An Owner
- **🚧 Construction Workers** - Development Team
- **📧 Email** - Discord
- **💡 Brainshedding** - Loadshedding

## 🚗 Realistic Driving

- 🛑 Avoid using your vehicle in unrealistic ways. For example, taking a supercar off-road would be considered Fail RP since it deviates from realistic driving.
- 🚓 While ramming by PD is prohibited, if you engage in break checking and they subsequently ram you, the responsibility falls on you.

## 👤 Your Character

- 🎭 It is of great importance to NEVER BREAK CHARACTER and always remain consistent with your character’s persona, including accents, behavior, and overall personality.
- 🧍 Your character defines you as a role-player. Never ignore or intentionally avoid roleplay.

## 💥 RDM and VDM

- **🔫 Random Death Match (RDM)**: Refers to a situation where a player intentionally kills or attacks another player’s character without any valid in-character reason or roleplay interaction.
- **🚗 Vehicle Death Match (VDM)**: Occurs when a player uses a vehicle to intentionally harm or kill other players’ characters without a valid in-character reason or proper roleplay context.

## 🚨 Rulesplaining

- 🛑 Refrain from incorporating city rules into your roleplay and/or explaining rule-breaking during roleplay interactions.

## 🎥 Body Cam/Footage

- 📹 It is recommended that players should always have their body cam running. "Body Cam" refers to having either Medal or Overwolf running to record your gameplay session. This is essential for when there are player reports, proving innocence or guilt.

## 💻 Hacking, Bugs, and Glitches

- 🚫 Using hacks, bugs, and glitches to gain an unfair advantage or disrupt the roleplay experience is strictly prohibited. Any player found exploiting such methods will be subjected to disciplinary action, including possible banning from the server.
- 🐞 If a player experiences a glitch or bug, it needs to be reported immediately.

## 📵 Metagaming

- 🚷 The act of using out-of-character (OOC) knowledge to influence in-character (IC) actions and decisions is prohibited. Examples include Stream Sniping and Discord Voice Chats.

## ⚔️ Powergaming

- 🚫 Powergaming refers to a style of roleplay where a player forces their character’s actions upon others without allowing any room for fair and realistic responses.
- 🛠 This includes using third-party mechanics such as hacks and cheats to benefit your character in the city.

## 💰 Pocket Wiping

- 💼 Items taken during robberies should make sense for the character taking the items. You cannot remove all items from a player. For example, you must leave items such as consumables (food and water). Only illegal items are allowed to be taken.

## 🏃‍♂️ Combat Logging

- 🚪 The act of abruptly disconnecting or exiting during a roleplay scene to avoid facing the consequences of your actions is considered a violation of RP rules.

## 🌱 New Life Rule

- 👻 The New Life Rule dictates that when a character dies in a specific RP situation, the player must forget all information and experiences 30 minutes prior to death.

## 🚨 Fail Roleplay

- 💀 Fail RP refers to instances in a roleplay setting where a player behaves in a manner that breaks the immersion of the scene or violates the established rules of the RP world.
- 🚔 No SAPS/EMS baiting will be allowed, which will result in a Tier warning.
- 👻 You are not allowed to /me when you are dead to communicate with someone else.
- 🎭 When a citizen wears a mask, you cannot identify them based on physical appearance and their voice.

## ❤️ Value Your Life/Valuing Others' Lives

- **Value Your Life**: Players should realistically consider their character’s life and the lives of others during roleplay. If your character is faced with a dangerous situation, such as being held at gunpoint, it is crucial to fear for your life and comply with the situation accordingly.
- **Valuing Others' Lives**: If a member/partner is being held at gunpoint, you should fear for their lives as you would your own. SAPS included. This is done to promote and further the roleplay scene.

## 🏢 Businesses

- 🚫 Business owners are not allowed to own more than one business at a time.
- 💰 Businesses are bought from the government at a set price and must be sold back to the government by the original purchaser.
- 🏢 A business owner is allowed to have a business partner (co-owner). If the original purchaser wants to sell the business, all rights of the co-owners are relinquished, and the business is sold back to the government at 50% of the purchase price.
- 🎭 Citizens are required to remove their masks when entering a business.
- 👥 Business Owners are responsible for Role Requests and Removals of their employees. 
- ⚠️ If a business is not active enough, they will receive a strike. Three strikes and the business will be repossessed by the government with no refund to the owner.
- 👥 Each business is only allowed ten employees, including the Owner.

## 👮 Whitelisted Jobs

- 🎓 Citizens may have a maximum of two whitelisted jobs.
- 🚓 Business owners, SAPS, and EMS may not have any other whitelisted job.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Criminal Activity

- 🕒 A crime-free period is enforced 30 minutes before and 15 minutes after the scheduled server restart. Failure to comply will result in a Tier warning.

- ⚠️ Gangs that break gang rules will receive a Strike. Three strikes will result in the gang being disbanded. All server rules apply to gangs, and failure to comply with these rules will lead to severe consequences, including strikes and potential disbandment. Gangs are expected to operate within the same standards as other players, upholding the integrity of the roleplay experience.
- 🛡️ The ADT unit works in collaboration with SAPS to enforce the law and handle security matters, especially during criminal activities such as petty theft and small crimes.

## 🕵️‍♀️ Gang Rules

- 🌍 Gang wars must be played out in Sandy Shores or Paleto Bay(away from the city), including territory wars.
- 🗣 Communication between both Gang Bosses is essential prior to the gang war. The conditions of the war need to be clearly stipulated and agreed upon by both gang bosses before the war commences.
- 🏠 Gang wars may take place at the respective gang houses or compounds.
- 🚔 **Fear RP**: All players, including gangs, are required to realistically fear for their lives when faced with dangerous situations. This means that even gangs must comply with demands if they are outnumbered or outgunned in a realistic manner.
- ⚠️ Gangs that break gang rules will receive a Strike. Three strikes will result in the gang being disbanded. All server rules apply to gangs, and failure to comply with these rules will lead to severe consequences, including strikes and potential disbandment. Gangs are expected to operate within the same standards as other players, upholding the integrity of the roleplay experience.
- 🚫 **Street Gangs (Non-Official Gangs)**: Street gangs are not permitted to grow beyond five members and cannot engage in activities that disrupt the balance of power among official gangs. If a street gang is found to be causing excessive disruption, they will be disbanded immediately.
- 🤝 **Small Groups vs. Gangs**: Small groups (non-gang members) may engage in hostile actions such as robbery or taking a gang member hostage if they have a clear and justified in-character reason. However, they must be able to realistically overpower the gang members in question, either through numbers or superior tactics.
- 🔫 **Overpowering a Gang**: Small groups attempting to rob or take a gang member hostage must be able to demonstrate a clear tactical advantage. This could be through superior numbers, better positioning, or more effective weapons. Gangs are still feared entities, but they are not invincible and must respond to realistic threats appropriately.
- 🚓 **SAPS & ADT Involvement**: If a small group successfully overpowers a gang, SAPS and ADT may become involved to maintain order and ensure that the situation does not escalate beyond roleplay boundaries.
